    "title": "Responsive design with Bootstrap",
    "author": "James Buchanan",
    "description": "Bootstrap is a HTML, CSS and JS framework which allows developers to use a broad range of open-source templates with many varying configurations that save the developer lots of time. Responsive design in the context of frontend development means ensuring that the webpage can be viewed and used without much difference between sizes of viewports. This is implemented on webpages in the meta tag within the head tag of the HTML document where the content-width is set to device width and initial-scaling is set to 1.0. Responsive design eliminates the need for having multiple different versions of a webpage for each screen size depending on which device is used. But Bootstrap also offers significant support for responsive design, an example would be the 12 column grid system implemented in Bootstrap which allows users to customize how elements are displayed on the webpage. Bootstrap also offers plenty of responsive utilities which can be used as classes of elements to implement a responsive design. Examples of this are font-scaling, pre-designed responsive elements like navigation bars, etc. These pre-designed elements are not always perfectly responsive and may sometimes require customization in the CSS stylesheet, but the sheer size of the Bootstrap library and number of available element classes and utility classes makes the job of the developer much easier than if they needed to write all the HTML and CSS code they required manually. Moreover, Bootstrap is so widely used by developers that not only is there extensive and well-maintained documentation but also a plethora of online resources created for developers that allow them to easily lookup specific element classes, manipulate the accompanying Bootstrap classes and see how the changes would look like in action.",

    "title": "HTML - an introduction",
    "author": "John Adams",
    "description": "HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is a markup language used to structure webpages and present them on the internet. It uses many kinds of tags, enclosed within angle brackets, which represent elements that can be included in the webpage and presented to the user. There are global attributes for each tag, such as class, and there are also individual attributes. This makes HTML tags significantly customizable. For example, an <a> (anchor) tag can have the href attribute to specify which URL the element points to, and the <img> (image) tag can have tbe src attribute which points to the image URL or where the image is being loaded from. HTML is used together with a styling language like CSS and a scripting language like Javascript, this allows the developer almost extreme freedom and possibility with what they can do with a webpage in terms of development. Other HTML tags that are commonly used are <p> for paragraph elements, <h1> through <h6> for headings of various sizes, and then there are the structural tags which are often centrepieces in any HTML document like the <main>, <body> and <head> tags. HTML5 has introduced new tags and attributes to provide greater interactivity and multimedia capabilities such as <audio>, <input> or <video>. With the advent of HTML and CSS frameworks, development in HTML is no longer as tedious as it used to be several years ago as developers from all over the world work with each other and contribute to open-source libraries filled with pre-designed templates of elements with desired functionality.",

    "title": "CSS - an introduction", 
    "author": "Ulysses Grant",
    "description": "CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a technology that is used in web development to control and adjust the styling and layout of HTML documents and the elements therein. It is an addition to HTML because it allows the developer to separately adjust how content should look like in a stylesheet. The way it works is by utilizing selectors of varying specificity, i.e ID, class or type selectors, with a ruleset for the relevant HTML elements. This allows the developer to apply attributes to the element of their choosing. There are many different kinds of attributes like fonts, padding, positioning, colors, margins, etc. An important feature is also inheritance of styles which allows different rulesets with a shared aspect among their selectors to become combined, but if there is a collision between identical selectors then the ruleset with the greater specificty and lower ordering in the stylesheet applies first. CSS can be included via the <style> tag directly in the HTML document, or it can also be included by adding the .css file itself to the HTML document as a stylesheet. CSS also provides support to responsive design because it allows developers to utilize media queries which lets them apply specific styles conditionally based on the device screen size or other aspects. This contributes to accessibility across multiple devices. CSS is a very important part of web development and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future given the modularity it provides to web development.",

    "title": "JavaScript - an introduction",
    "author": "Gerald Ford",
    "description": "Javascript is a programming (sometimes known as a scripting) language which can be used to add dynamic behavior, enhance user experience and greater interactivity to a webpage. Javascript can be used client-side to allow developers to conrtrol or modify HTML elements and CSS rulesets as a user is visiting the webpage in real-time, depending on what is happening or what they are doing. This means that Javascript can be used to tailor webpage and HTML/CSS behavior to user interaction. A way this manifests is in SPA, Single Page Applications. Hard reloads of webpages are avoided by using Javascript to load particular parts of HTML code as needed, for example if a user clicks on a button then they are shown a dialogue which can later be closed, while the user can also visit another page on the website without a reload. This is made possible by Javascript. However it is also used to bridge the client-server model and allow retrieval of data from the backend into the frontend. There are many Javascript frameworks like Vue.js, React and Angular which have all contributed to development become far more efficient than it otherwise could be via pre-built components and the like which particularly helps with building SPAs that function seamlessly. With regards to the backend (server-side) capabilities, Javascript has been extended by Node.js and other similar development platforms. It has allowed users to build server applications using the same language they would use for client-side scripting. Needless to say, the libraries available for Javascript are absolutely massive and make it easy for any developer to obtain the tools they need for their development goals.",
